            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless BukiCookie and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violations of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.

            <h3>17. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

You consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p>
            
            <h3>18. Changes to Terms</h3>

            <h3>39. No Waiver</h3>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

            <h3>40. Severability</h3>
